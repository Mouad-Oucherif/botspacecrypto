This bot is open source, so anyone can see it, fork it, or update it.

I developed this bot initially for my personal use. I decided to publish it here to help people and in the hope of earning a little money with donations. Over time more and more people were opening issues, asking for help, and giving suggestions. I try to answer everyone, but lately it's been hard to keep up with demand.

I would like to keep this bot free and open source. To make this possible, I'm creating some donation goals so that the bot can be collectively funded. Currently I will update the goals bar manually on a daily basis, maybe in the future I will automate the process somehow.
